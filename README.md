# Battleships-ArduinoAndProcessing
Implementation of the Battleships Game in Arduino and Processing library. 

I used a Digilent keypad to enter the coordinates of the ships and the bombs. The connection to the keypad and its data processing is done in Arduino, while the GUI is done in Processing. The connection between Arduino and Processing is made with the serial monitor.
